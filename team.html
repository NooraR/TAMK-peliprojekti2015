			<h2>Ilmari Kinnunen - Programmer</h2>
		
			<p class="esittelyteksti"> Ilmari already had a lot of experience with programming 
			so of course he is our main programmer. As the main pessimist of the team he gives 
			great critique on a lot of different things. Ilmari is more interested in what comes 
			after the project.
			</p>

			<h2>Noora Rintam&#228;ki - scrummaster & web programmer</h2>
		
			<p class="esittelyteksti"> Our team's scrum master is also our group's only optimist. 
			Noora is always encouraging and makes sure that the project stays on schedule. She 
			also works on developer this website and wrote the learning materials.
			</p>
		
			<br>
		
			<h2>Jesse Lehto - web programmer & trailer</h2>
		
			<p class="esittelyteksti"> Jesse is slightly more optimistic than the other pessimists, 
			but he is still a pessimist. He works as the other developer for the website. He felt 
			that he needed more work to do so he also made the trailer and does other small things 
			when needed.
			</p>
			
			<br>
		
			<h2>Viivi Koponen - graphic designer</h2>
		
			<p class="esittelyteksti">Viivi is Attack on Titan and bird maniac. She is our team's 
			only proficient artist so naturally she is also our graphic designer. She also knows 
			video editing. Viivi has a cheery attitude even though project's challenges make her 
			a little nervous.
			</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h2>Janne Koskinen - programmer</h2>
		
			<p class="esittelyteksti">Janne came to business information systems from the 
			engineering side and he is our second programmer. His main duties are level design 
			and UX design. He feels that project is a daunting challenge and feels that project 
			execution could be done better.
