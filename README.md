This campaign website was created as part of TAMKs mobile game project for Android platform. In this project, we created a website and a game for educational purposes. Theme was to help studying math, physics or chemistry.

Phosphorus is the first game I have worked on. It was done as a school project and released in Google Play. We had a five member scrum team. My role in the team was scrummaster and web desing. The project gave a great real-life experience what it takes to make an educational game.

Graphics used on website were made by other person.

The published game is in Google Play:
