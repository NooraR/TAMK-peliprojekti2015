Creating a mobile game for Android platform in Scrum project, including design of campaign website.

In this project, we created a website and a game for educational purposes. Theme was to help studying math, physics or chemistry.

Feathers is the first game I have worked on. It was done as a school project and released in Google Play. We had a five member scrum team.
My role in the team was scrummaster and web desing. The project gave a great real-life experience what it takes to make an educational game. 

The published game is in Google Play:
