			<p>Sight requires light. The human eye can only perceive sources of light and objects that 
			reflect light. The wavelength of visible light is around 400-700 nm. Different wavelengths 
			of the light appear as different colors. For example, the wavelength of blue light is about 
			400 nm while the wavelength of red light is about 700 nm.</p>
				
			<p>White light (ex. sunlight) is composed of a mixture of different wavelengths. When white 
			light hits a prism in the right angle, the light splits into a spectrum of different colors. 
			Different wavelengths of light refract at different angles. Because of this, a white light 
			is is broken down to it's component colors. </p>
				
			<p>When light hits an object the light will either reflect from it, gets absorbed by it or 
			goes through it. In many situations all three phenomena happen simultaneously. Bright-colored 
			objects reflect light very well. Usually an object reflects only a part of the light that hits 
			the surface and the rest gets absorbed into the object. If the object doesn&#8217;t reflect the light 
			at all it appears to be completely black. In the case of a transparent object most of the light 
			goes through the object and the rest gets reflected from the surface. An example of an object 
			like this is glass. If glass didn't reflect light at all, it would be impossible to see it unless 
			the light shone through it. </p>
				
			<p>Light is measured by illuminance and by the unit lux (lx). Illuminance measures how brightly 
			a measured spot is illuminated. For example, on a sunny summer day illuminance is about 180 000 lx 
			while in moonlight it is only about 0.2 lx.</p>

			<p>When light reflects from an even surface its reflection angle (the line on right side) is equal 
			to the incoming light(line on left side) relative to the surface&#8217;s normal. </p>

			<p><b>Light source </b> = An object that emits light. </p>
			
			<p><b>Illuminance</b> =  A measure of how well a place is illuminated. The unit is lux(lx). </p>
			
			<p><b>Shadow</b> = A dark area that is formed when a blocking object is in-between the area and a light source. </p>
			
			<p><b>White light </b> = When dispersed, it can be seen that it is composed of different wavelengths of light. </p>
